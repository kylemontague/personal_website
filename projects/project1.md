### Enabling Ongoingness

**Research Focus:** Design, Lived Experience and Bereavement

One aim of the project is to find new ways to capture and represent something meaningful about an individual and their relationships through a combination of physical things and digital media (which could mean photographs, music, film clips etc). 

We hope to better understand the potential benefits that design and digital technologies can bring to people to offer new ways to:

- **Express a sense of who they are** in the present, but also for the future
- **Make objects and media content** that will support other people after one's death
- **Enable people, who are already bereaved**, to maintain lasting bonds in new ways with someone who has now died

**Key Themes:**
- Ongoingness as a framework for design
- Making design prototypes that explore how ongoingness could play out in peoples' lives
- Supporting meaningful connections across time and loss

**Research Approach:**
This project employs design research methods working with people who are bereaved and those living with life-limiting conditions. Through co-design and participatory approaches, we explore how digital and physical artifacts can support ongoing relationships and meaningful remembering.

The work contributes to understanding how technology can be designed to support sensitive and deeply personal aspects of human experience, with implications for end-of-life care, bereavement support, and the design of technologies that acknowledge and enable ongoing bonds.
