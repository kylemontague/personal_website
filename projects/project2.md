### Design Space of Nonvisual Word Completion

**Research Focus:** Accessibility and Assistive Technologies for Screen Reader Users

Word completion interfaces are ubiquitously available in mobile virtual keyboards; however, there is no prior research on how to design these interfaces for screen reader users. In addressing this, we propose a design space for nonvisual representation of word completions.

**The Challenge:**
While sighted users benefit from visual word completion suggestions when typing on mobile devices, blind and visually impaired screen reader users face significant barriers in accessing and using these same features. The visual presentation of word suggestions is not directly translatable to nonvisual interaction modalities.

**Our Contribution:**
The design space covers seven categories aiming to identify challenges and opportunities for interaction design in this unexplored research topic. It provides:

- A comprehensive framework for understanding nonvisual word completion
- Identification of key design dimensions and trade-offs
- Guidelines for creating accessible word completion interfaces
- A foundation for future research and development

**Design Space Categories:**
The framework addresses critical aspects of nonvisual interaction including:
- Presentation modalities (audio, haptic, combined)
- Navigation and selection mechanisms
- Timing and feedback considerations
- Integration with screen reader workflows
- Customization and user control
- Context awareness and adaptation
- Privacy and discretion

**Impact:**
This work serves as a framework for researchers and practitioners working on nonvisual word completion, guiding the design of novel interaction techniques that can improve text entry efficiency and user experience for screen reader users. The design space opens new opportunities for creating more inclusive and accessible mobile interfaces.

**Research Methods:**
Through co-design sessions with blind and visually impaired participants, combined with systematic analysis of existing interfaces, we identified key challenges and opportunities in this space. The resulting design space provides both theoretical contributions and practical guidance for accessible interface design.
